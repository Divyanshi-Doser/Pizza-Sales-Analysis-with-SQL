# Pizza Sales Analysis - SQL Queries

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales Analysis** project!

This repository contains a series of SQL queries designed to analyze a pizza sales dataset. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to extract valuable insights from the sales data of a pizza restaurant or business.
